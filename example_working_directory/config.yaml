    #     barcodeGroups:  # names demultiplexed files according to given name instead of using name(s) of individual barcodes. groups must use the same pattern of barcode types.
    #                     #   For instance, if one group contains barcode designations for two barcodes types (e.g., fwd and rvs), then all other groups must contain barcode designations for those two barcode types
    #                     #   Names must also be a string. If a numerical barcodeGroup is desired, it must be flanked with quotation marks to convert it to a string.
