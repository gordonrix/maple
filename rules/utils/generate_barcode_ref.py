"""
Automated generation of barcode fasta files
    For each barcode type, if generate:x option is set, will generate a fasta file containing
    x barcode sequences appearing in the specified sequence context in the provided BAM file.
    Sequences are chosen based upon frequency of appearance, with only the most frequently appearing
    sequences written to the file. If hammingDistance:h option is also set, all sequences written
    will be of hamming distance > h from each other

Input: BAM file

Output: barcodes fasta file, name defined in config file for each barcodeType
