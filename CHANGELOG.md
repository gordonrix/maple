- Plotting of RCA consensus stats
- Sequence clustering / dimensionality reduction using PaCMAP
- Scatter plotting of dimension-reduced genotypes

## v0.8.6
# Major

- removed support for Guppy basecaller (difficult to maintain and live basecalling is much preferred)
# Minor
- Batch size option for RCA in config
